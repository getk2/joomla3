# Joomla 3.x with ELTS &amp; PHP 8.3 patches

This is work in progress.

Once this distribution is fully patched with current ELTS & PHP 8.3+ patches, we will start releasing ready to install packages.

So if you're interested in using this distribution, keep an eye on this repo or follow us on X at: httpx://x.com/joomlaworks

Our plan is to transition to a K2-based distribution of Joomla 3.x, on a separate repository. If you'd like to read more about this, have a look at:
